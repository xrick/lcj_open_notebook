# Deployment Guide

This section provides comprehensive guides for deploying Open Notebook in different environments, from simple local setups to production deployments.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**New to Open Notebook?** Start with the [Docker Setup Guide](docker.md) - it's the fastest way to get up and running.

## üìã Deployment Options

### 1. [Docker Deployment](docker.md)
**Recommended for most users**
- Complete beginner-friendly guide
- Single-container and multi-container options
- Supports all major AI providers
- Perfect for local development and testing

### 2. [Single Container Deployment](single-container.md)
**Best for platforms like PikaPods**
- All-in-one container solution
- Simplified deployment process
- Ideal for cloud hosting platforms
- Lower resource requirements

### 3. [Development Setup](development.md)
**For contributors and advanced users**
- Local development environment
- Source code installation
- Development tools and debugging
- Contributing to the project

### 4. [Security Configuration](security.md)
**Essential for public deployments**
- Password protection setup
- Security best practices
- Production deployment considerations
- Troubleshooting security issues

## üéØ Choose Your Deployment Method

### Use Docker Setup if:
- You're new to Open Notebook
- You want the easiest setup experience
- You need multiple AI provider support
- You're running locally or on a private server

### Use Single Container if:
- You're deploying on PikaPods, Railway, or similar platforms
- You want the simplest possible deployment
- You have resource constraints
- You don't need to scale services independently

### Use Development Setup if:
- You want to contribute to the project
- You need to modify the source code
- You're developing integrations or plugins
- You want to understand the codebase
