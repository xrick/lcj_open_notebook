## What is Open Notebook?

Open Notebook is a powerful, open-source AI-powered research and note-taking platform that puts privacy and user control at the heart of knowledge management. Designed as a privacy-focused alternative to Google's Notebook LM, Open Notebook empowers researchers, students, and professionals to organize, analyze, and interact with their research materials using cutting-edge AI technology‚Äîall while maintaining complete control over their data.

At its core, Open Notebook serves as your personal **cognitive partner**, helping you process information, generate insights, and create compelling content from your research materials. Whether you're a student working on a thesis, a researcher analyzing complex documents, or a professional synthesizing industry reports, Open Notebook provides the tools to enhance your learning and knowledge creation workflows.
