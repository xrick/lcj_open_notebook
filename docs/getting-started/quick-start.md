# Quick Start Guide - Get Open Notebook Running in 5 Minutes

Get up and running with Open Notebook in just a few minutes! This guide will get you from zero to your first AI-powered notebook quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. **Docker Desktop** installed and running
   - [Download for Windows/Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Linux: `sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose`

2. **OpenAI API Key** (recommended for beginners)
   - Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
   - Create account ‚Üí API Keys ‚Üí Create new secret key
   - Add $5+ credits to your account for API usage

## Single Command Setup

### Step 1: Create Your Setup Files

Create a new folder called `open-notebook` and add these two files:

**docker-compose.yml**:
```yaml
services:
  open_notebook:
    image: lfnovo/open_notebook:latest-single
    ports:
      - "8502:8502"
    env_file:
      - ./docker.env
    pull_policy: always
    volumes:
      - ./notebook_data:/app/data
      - ./surreal_single_data:/mydata
    restart: always
```

**docker.env**:
```env
# Replace YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE with your actual API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE

# Database settings (don't change these)
SURREAL_ADDRESS=localhost
SURREAL_PORT=8000
SURREAL_USER=root
SURREAL_PASS=root
SURREAL_NAMESPACE=open_notebook
SURREAL_DATABASE=production
```

### Step 2: Start Open Notebook

Open terminal/command prompt in your `open-notebook` folder and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**That's it!** Open Notebook is now running at: **http://localhost:8502**

## Basic Verification

1. **Check Services**: Visit http://localhost:8502 - you should see the Open Notebook interface
2. **API Health**: Visit http://localhost:5055/docs - you should see the API documentation
3. **No Errors**: Run `docker-compose logs` to ensure no error messages
