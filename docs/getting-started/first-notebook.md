# Your First Notebook - A Complete Walkthrough

Welcome to Open Notebook! This guide will walk you through creating your first notebook and experiencing all the core features that make Open Notebook a powerful research and note-taking tool. By the end of this walkthrough, you'll have created a notebook, added sources, generated AI insights, and learned how to effectively use the chat assistant.

## Understanding the Interface

Open Notebook uses a clean three-column layout designed to optimize your research workflow:

- **Left Column**: Your sources and notes - all the content you've added to your notebook
- **Middle Column**: The main workspace where you'll interact with transformations and view detailed content
- **Right Column**: The AI chat assistant and context management

This layout keeps your sources visible while you work, making it easy to reference materials and manage what information the AI can access.

## Step 1: Creating Your First Notebook

Let's start by creating a notebook for a sample research project.

1. **Click "New Notebook"** on the main dashboard
2. **Choose a descriptive name** - for this example, let's use "Climate Change Research"
3. **Write a detailed description** - this is crucial as it helps the AI understand your research context

   Example description:
   ```
   Research notebook focused on climate change impacts, solutions, and policy. 
   Collecting information from scientific papers, news articles, and expert interviews 
   to understand current trends and potential mitigation strategies.
   ```

4. **Click "Create Notebook"**

**ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: The more detailed your description, the better the AI will understand your research goals and provide relevant insights.

## Step 2: Adding Your First Sources

Now let's add different types of content to your notebook. We'll add three different source types to demonstrate the flexibility.

### Adding a Web Article

1. **Click "Add Source"** in the left column
2. **Select "Link"** as your source type
3. **Paste a URL** - try this example: `https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/`
4. **Add a title** like "IPCC Climate Report"
5. **Click "Add Source"**

The system will automatically scrape the content and make it searchable.

### Adding a Text Note

1. **Click "Add Source"** again
2. **Select "Text"** as your source type
3. **Paste or type content** - you can add research notes, quotes, or any text content
4. **Give it a descriptive title** like "Key Climate Statistics"
5. **Click "Add Source"**

### Adding a File

1. **Click "Add Source"** one more time
2. **Select "File"** as your source type
3. **Upload a PDF, document, or other supported file**
4. **The system will automatically extract the text content**

You'll now see all your sources listed in the left column:

## Step 3: Generating Your First AI Insights

Now that you have content, let's generate some AI insights using transformations.

1. **Click on one of your sources** in the left column
2. **Look for the "Transformations" section** in the middle column
3. **Try a pre-built transformation** like "Summarize" or "Key Points"
4. **Click "Generate"** to create your first AI insight

The AI will analyze your content and provide insights based on the transformation you selected. These insights can be saved as notes for future reference.

**ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: Transformations are customizable prompts. You can create your own transformations for specific research needs, like "Extract methodology" or "Identify key arguments."

## Step 4: Understanding Context Settings

Before chatting with the AI, it's important to understand how context works. This is one of Open Notebook's most powerful features.

For each source, you can set:

- **Not in Context**: The AI won't see this content (saves on API costs)
- **Summary**: The AI gets a summary and can request full content if needed (balanced approach)
- **Full Content**: The AI gets the complete text (most comprehensive but uses more tokens)

### Setting Up Context for Your First Chat

1. **Click on the context toggle** next to each source
2. **For your first try, set one source to "Full Content"**
3. **Set others to "Summary"** to balance cost and performance
4. **Leave any sensitive sources as "Not in Context"**

## Step 5: Your First Chat with the AI

Now let's have a conversation with the AI assistant about your research.

1. **Look at the right column** for the chat interface
2. **Type your first question** - try something like:
   ```
   What are the main causes of climate change discussed in my sources?
   ```
3. **Press Enter** to send your question

The AI will analyze your sources (based on your context settings) and provide a comprehensive answer. Notice how it references specific sources in its response.

### Try These Follow-up Questions:

- "What solutions are mentioned for addressing climate change?"
- "Can you compare the different perspectives in my sources?"
- "What are the key statistics I should remember?"

## Step 6: Saving Important Information as Notes

When the AI provides a particularly useful response, you can save it as a note:

1. **Look for the "Save as Note" button** under any AI response
2. **Click it** to convert the response into a permanent note
3. **Edit the title** if needed
4. **The note will appear in your left column** for easy reference

![AI Notes](/assets/ai_note.png)

You can also create manual notes:

1. **Click "Add Note"** in the left column
2. **Write your own observations** or insights
3. **Save** to keep them with your research

## Step 7: Working with Multiple Chat Threads

For complex research, you might want separate conversations:

1. **Look for the "New Chat" option** in the chat interface
2. **Create topic-specific chats** like:
   - "Policy Analysis"
   - "Technical Details"
   - "Literature Review"

Each chat maintains its own context and history, helping you stay organized.

## Step 8: Using Search Across Your Research

As your notebook grows, use the search feature to find information quickly:

1. **Go to the Search page** (if available in your interface)
2. **Search by keywords** or use semantic search
3. **Find relevant notes and sources** across all your notebooks
