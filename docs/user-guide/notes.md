# Notes User Guide

Notes are the heart of your research workflow in Open Notebook. They provide a flexible system for capturing, organizing, and building upon your insights. This guide covers everything you need to know to get the most out of your note-taking experience.

## Manual Note Creation

### Creating Your First Note

The simplest way to create a note is manually:

1. **Access the Notes Panel**: Inside any notebook page, you'll find a dedicated column for your notes
2. **Click "Add Note"**: Look for the "Add Note" button in the notes section
3. **Add Title and Content**: Enter a descriptive title and write your note content
4. **Save**: Your note is automatically saved and becomes part of your notebook

### Best Practices for Manual Notes

- **Use descriptive titles**: Make your notes easy to find later with clear, specific titles
- **Keep notes focused**: Each note should cover a single concept or idea
- **Use consistent formatting**: Develop a personal style for structuring your notes
- **Date important insights**: Add timestamps for time-sensitive information

## AI-Assisted Note Generation

Open Notebook provides powerful AI features to help you create more insightful notes with less effort.

### Creating Notes from Source Insights

Transform research insights into permanent notes:

1. **Generate Source Insights**: Use [Transformations](/features/transformations.html) to analyze your sources
2. **Review the Insight**: Read through the AI-generated insight to ensure it captures what you need
3. **Click "Save as Note"**: Convert the insight directly into a note with one click
4. **Edit and Enhance**: Customize the note title and content as needed

### Creating Notes from Chat Conversations

Capture valuable AI conversations as notes:

1. **Chat with the Assistant**: Have a conversation about your research topic
2. **Identify Useful Responses**: Look for AI messages that provide valuable insights
3. **Click "Save as Note"**: Use the "Save as Note" button on any AI message
4. **Review and Edit**: The message becomes a note that you can modify and expand

### Using Transformations for Note Enhancement

Transformations can help you create different types of notes:

- **Summary Notes**: Create concise overviews of complex sources
