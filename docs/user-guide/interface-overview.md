# Interface Overview

Open Notebook features a clean, intuitive interface designed to streamline your research workflow. This guide covers the layout, navigation, and interaction patterns to help you work efficiently with the platform.

## Interface Design Philosophy

Open Notebook follows a three-column layout inspired by Google Notebook LM but enhanced with additional features and customization options. The design prioritizes:

- **Workspace Organization**: Clear separation between content management and AI interaction
- **Context Awareness**: Visual indicators for what information is available to the AI
- **Privacy Control**: Granular control over data sharing with AI models
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Logical progression from source management to knowledge creation

## Three-Column Layout

### Main Workspace (Left Side)
The main workspace is divided into two columns that manage your research materials:

#### Sources Column (Left)
- **Add Source Button**: Quick access to add new research materials
- **Source Cards**: Visual representations of your documents, URLs, and other content
- **Context Indicators**: Visual cues showing whether sources are included in AI context
- **Source Actions**: Edit, delete, and transformation options for each source

#### Notes Column (Right)
- **Write a Note Button**: Create manual notes and observations
- **Note Cards**: Display both human-written and AI-generated notes
- **Note Types**: Visual distinction between manual and AI-generated content
- **Note Actions**: Edit, delete, and organization options

### Chat Interface (Right Side)
The chat interface provides AI interaction capabilities:

#### Chat Tab

## Context Control System

### Three-Level Context System
Open Notebook provides granular control over what information AI models can access:

#### Not in Context
- Sources and notes marked as "not in context" are invisible to the AI
- Useful for keeping sensitive or irrelevant information private
- Reduces API costs by limiting context size

#### Summary Only
- AI receives condensed summaries of the content
- Balances information access with cost optimization
- AI can request full content if needed for specific queries

#### Full Content
- AI has access to complete document text
- Provides maximum context for detailed analysis
- Higher API costs but most comprehensive responses

### Context Indicators
Visual indicators throughout the interface show:
- **Token Count**: Current context size in tokens
- **Character Count**: Total characters in context
- **Context Composition**: What sources and notes are included
- **Cost Estimation**: Approximate API usage for current context
