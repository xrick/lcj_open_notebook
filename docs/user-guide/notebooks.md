## Creating and Managing Notebooks

### Creating a New Notebook

1. **Access the Notebooks Page**: Navigate to **üìí Notebooks** in the sidebar
2. **Click "New Notebook"**: Find the expandable "‚ûï New Notebook" section
3. **Provide Essential Information**:
   - **Name**: Choose a clear, descriptive name that will help you identify the notebook later
   - **Description**: Write a detailed description explaining the notebook's purpose, scope, and research goals

#### Writing Effective Notebook Descriptions

Your notebook description is crucial for AI interactions. The more detailed and specific you make it, the better the AI will understand your research context. Include:

- **Research objectives**: What you're trying to accomplish
- **Target audience**: Who will use this research
- **Key topics**: Main areas of focus
- **Methodology**: How you plan to approach the research
- **Expected outcomes**: What you hope to achieve

**Example Description:**
```
Research notebook focused on climate change impacts on coastal cities. 
Collecting scientific papers, policy documents, and case studies from 
major coastal metropolitan areas. Goal is to understand adaptation 
strategies and policy recommendations for urban planning departments. 
Target audience: city planners and policy makers.
```

### Managing Existing Notebooks

#### Viewing Notebook List

The main Notebooks page displays all your notebooks with:
- **Name and description**: Clear identification of each notebook
- **Creation and update timestamps**: Track when notebooks were created and last modified
- **Archive status**: Visual distinction between active and archived notebooks

#### Editing Notebook Details

1. **Open the notebook** you want to edit
2. **Click on the description area** (or "click to add a description" if empty)
3. **Modify the details**:
   - Update the name in the text input field
   - Edit the description in the text area
   - Use the placeholder text as guidance for comprehensive descriptions
4. **Save changes** by clicking the "üíæ Save" button

#### Archiving and Unarchiving

**To Archive a Notebook:**
1. Open the notebook
2. Expand the description section
3. Click "üóÉÔ∏è Archive"
4. The notebook will be moved to the archived section

**To Unarchive a Notebook:**
1. Find the notebook in the "üóÉÔ∏è Archived Notebooks" section
2. Open the notebook
3. Expand the description section
4. Click "üóÉÔ∏è Unarchive"

**Important Notes:**
- Archived notebooks remain searchable and accessible
