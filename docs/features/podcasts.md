# Environment variable configuration
export TTS_BATCH_SIZE=3  # Number of concurrent TTS requests (default: 5)
```

**Recommended Settings by Provider:**
- **OpenAI TTS**: `TTS_BATCH_SIZE=5` (default, handles high concurrency well)
- **ElevenLabs**: `TTS_BATCH_SIZE=2` (strict rate limits, reduce for stability)
- **Google TTS**: `TTS_BATCH_SIZE=4` (moderate concurrency tolerance)
- **Custom/Local TTS**: `TTS_BATCH_SIZE=1` (depends on hardware/setup)

**Performance Trade-offs:**
- **Higher values (4-5)**: Faster podcast generation, higher provider load
- **Lower values (1-2)**: Slower generation, more reliable for rate-limited providers
- **Optimal setting**: Balance between speed and provider stability

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Generation Failures
#### **Insufficient Content**
- **Problem**: Episode generation fails with sparse source material
- **Solution**: Ensure notebook contains substantial research content
- **Prevention**: Aim for 1000+ words of source material

#### **API Quota Limits**
- **Problem**: TTS or LLM API limits exceeded
- **Solution**: Check API quotas and upgrade plans if needed
- **Prevention**: Monitor usage and set up billing alerts

#### **TTS Concurrency Issues**
- **Problem**: TTS provider rate limiting or concurrent request failures
- **Solution**: Configure TTS batch size to reduce parallel audio generation
- **Environment Variable**: `TTS_BATCH_SIZE=2` (default: 5)
- **Usage**: Lower values reduce provider load but increase generation time
```bash
# Reduce concurrent TTS requests for providers with strict limits
export TTS_BATCH_SIZE=2
# or
export TTS_BATCH_SIZE=1  # Most conservative, slowest
```

#### **Voice Configuration Errors**
- **Problem**: Specific voice not available or misconfigured
- **Solution**: Verify TTS provider settings and voice availability
- **Prevention**: Test voice configurations before full generation

### Audio Quality Issues
#### **Poor Audio Quality**
- **Problem**: Distorted or low-quality audio output
- **Solution**: Check TTS provider settings and audio format configuration
- **Prevention**: Use recommended providers and quality settings

#### **Inconsistent Volume**
- **Problem**: Speakers at different volume levels
- **Solution**: Enable audio normalization in settings
- **Prevention**: Use consistent TTS provider for all speakers

#### **Unnatural Speech**
- **Problem**: Robotic or awkward speech patterns
- **Solution**: Adjust personality settings and try different TTS providers
- **Prevention**: Test speaker configurations with sample content

### Performance Issues
#### **Slow Generation**
- **Problem**: Podcast generation takes excessive time
- **Solution**: Check API response times and consider provider switching
- **Prevention**: Monitor system resources and API performance

#### **Memory Issues**
- **Problem**: High memory usage during generation
- **Solution**: Reduce concurrent podcast generations
- **Prevention**: Monitor system resources and optimize content size

### Content Issues
#### **Repetitive Content**
- **Problem**: Speakers repeating same information
- **Solution**: Improve source material diversity and speaker role definitions
- **Prevention**: Ensure varied source content and clear speaker differentiation

#### **Off-Topic Discussions**
