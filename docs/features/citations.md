# Citations & References

Open Notebook's citation system ensures research integrity and transparency by providing accurate source attribution for all AI-generated insights. This comprehensive guide covers how citations work throughout the platform and how to leverage them for academic and research workflows.

## Overview

The citation system in Open Notebook is built around the principle of **transparent and verifiable research**. Every AI-generated response includes proper source attribution, allowing you to trace claims back to their original sources. This system supports various academic and professional workflows while maintaining the highest standards of research integrity.

### Key Features

- **Clickable Citation Links**: Direct access to original source content
- **Context-Aware Citations**: Citations adapt based on the content included in AI context
- **Multiple Citation Formats**: Support for various citation styles and formats
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Citations work across chat, search, and note-taking features
- **Export Compatibility**: Citations are preserved in exported content

## How Citations Work in Open Notebook

### Automatic Citation Generation

Open Notebook automatically generates citations whenever AI models reference your source materials. The system:

1. **Tracks Source Usage**: Monitors which sources are referenced in AI responses
2. **Extracts Specific References**: Identifies exact quotes, paraphrases, and concept references
3. **Generates Attribution**: Creates proper citations with source identification
4. **Maintains Context**: Preserves the relationship between claims and sources

### Citation Components

Each citation in Open Notebook includes:

- **Source Identification**: Clear identification of the referenced document
- **Content Location**: Specific sections, pages, or chunks referenced
- **Link to Original**: Direct access to the full source material
- **Attribution Context**: How the source was used in the AI response

### Citation Accuracy

The system ensures citation accuracy through:

- **Source Verification**: Cross-referencing claims against original content
- **Context Matching**: Ensuring citations match the actual content used
- **Quote Precision**: Accurate representation of direct quotes and paraphrases
- **Relationship Tracking**: Maintaining the connection between insights and sources

## Using Citations in Chat

### Understanding Chat Citations

When you engage with the AI assistant in chat, citations appear automatically when sources are referenced:

```
AI: According to the research presented in "Machine Learning Fundamentals" [1], 
neural networks require careful hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

[1] Machine Learning Fundamentals - Section 3.2: Neural Network Training
```

### Requesting Better Citations

You can improve citation quality by:

**Asking for Specific References**:
- "Please provide the exact quote that supports this point"
- "Which page in the document contains this information?"
- "Can you cite the specific study mentioned?"

**Requesting Citation Formats**:
- "Please include page numbers for all references"
- "Can you provide APA-style citations for these sources?"
- "Include direct quotes with proper attribution"

### Verifying Citation Accuracy

Always verify citations by:

1. **Clicking Citation Links**: Access the original source content
2. **Cross-Checking Claims**: Compare AI statements with source material
3. **Context Verification**: Ensure citations are used appropriately
4. **Completeness Check**: Confirm important sources aren't missing

### Best Practices for Chat Citations
