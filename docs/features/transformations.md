# Transformations

Transformations are a core feature of Open Notebook that provide a flexible and powerful way to generate new insights by applying customizable processing steps to your content. Inspired by the [Fabric framework](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric), transformations enable you to automatically distill, summarize, and enrich your research materials in meaningful ways.

## What are Transformations?

A **Transformation** is a customizable AI-powered process that modifies text input to produce structured, meaningful output. Whether you're summarizing articles, extracting key insights, generating reflective questions, or creating content outlines, transformations automate the processing of your research materials according to your specific needs.

Transformations work by:
- Taking your source content as input
- Applying a custom prompt template that defines the processing logic
- Using AI models to generate structured output
- Automatically creating new cards in your notebook with the results

## Core Components

### Transformation Elements

Each transformation consists of several key components:

- **Name**: Internal identifier for your reference
- **Title**: Displayed as the title of all cards created by this transformation
- **Description**: Helpful hint shown in the UI to explain the transformation's purpose
- **Prompt**: The actual AI prompt template that defines how content should be processed
- **Apply Default**: Whether this transformation should be suggested for all new sources

### Default Transformation Prompt

The system includes a configurable default transformation prompt that gets prepended to all transformations. This allows you to:
- Set consistent tone and style across all transformations
- Define global requirements or constraints
- Include instructions that prevent AI models from refusing certain tasks due to content policies

## Built-in Transformation Types

Open Notebook comes with several common transformation patterns that you can use immediately or customize:

### Content Analysis
- **Summarization**: Extract key points and main ideas from lengthy content
- **Insight Extraction**: Identify important insights, conclusions, and implications
- **Question Generation**: Create thoughtful questions for deeper reflection
- **Key Concepts**: Extract and define important terms and concepts

### Research Support
- **Literature Review**: Analyze academic papers and research content
- **Citation Extraction**: Pull out important quotes and references
- **Methodology Analysis**: Break down research methods and approaches

- **Action Items**: Extract actionable tasks and next steps
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare and contrast different perspectives
- **Trend Identification**: Spot patterns and emerging themes

## Custom Transformation Creation

### Creating Your Own Transformations

1. **Navigate to Transformations**: Go to the Transformations page in the UI
2. **Create New**: Click the "New Transformation" button
3. **Configure Settings**:
   - Enter a descriptive name for internal reference
   - Set a title that will appear on generated cards

### Prompt Design Best Practices

When creating custom prompts, consider these guidelines:

**Structure Your Prompts**:
```
# ROLE
You are an expert researcher analyzing academic content.

# TASK
Extract the 5 most important insights from the following text.

# FORMAT
Present each insight as:
- **Insight**: [Brief description]
- **Evidence**: [Supporting details from text]
- **Implications**: [Why this matters]

# CONSTRAINTS
- Focus on actionable insights
- Avoid redundancy
- Cite specific examples from the text
```

**Use Template Variables**:
- Access source metadata with `{{ source.title }}`, `{{ source.url }}`
- Reference the current timestamp with `{{ current_time }}`
- Include custom data passed to the transformation

**Consider Output Format**:
- Use markdown for structured output
- Include headings for better organization
- Format lists and tables for readability

## Batch Processing Capabilities

### Applying Transformations at Scale

Transformations can be applied to multiple sources simultaneously:

1. **Source Selection**: Select multiple sources from your notebook
2. **Transformation Choice**: Choose which transformation to apply
3. **Batch Execution**: Process all selected sources with the same transformation
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor the processing status of each source

### Performance Considerations

- **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models for your content type and complexity
- **Content Length**: Longer content may require more processing time and tokens
- **Concurrent Processing**: The system processes multiple transformations efficiently
- **Resource Management**: Monitor token usage and processing costs

## Transformation Management and Organization

### Organizing Your Transformations

**Categories and Tags**:
- Group related transformations by purpose
- Use descriptive names and clear descriptions
- Maintain a logical ordering for frequently used transformations

**Version Control**:
- Keep track of prompt changes over time
- Test modifications before applying to important content
- Maintain backup copies of successful transformation configurations

**Sharing and Collaboration**:
- Export transformation configurations for sharing
- Create standardized transformations for team use
- Document transformation purposes and best practices

## Integration with Other Features
