# Context Management: Your Data, Your Control

Open Notebook's context management system is a revolutionary feature that gives you **granular control** over what information gets shared with AI models. Unlike traditional research tools that send all your data to AI providers, Open Notebook empowers you to make precise decisions about context sharing, balancing functionality with privacy and cost control.

## Understanding Context Levels

Open Notebook provides three distinct context levels, each designed for different use cases and privacy requirements:

### ðŸš« Not in Context
**"â›” not in context"**

- **What it does**: Completely excludes the source or note from AI interactions
- **Data sharing**: Zero information sent to AI providers
- **Use cases**: 
  - Highly sensitive or confidential documents
  - Personal notes you don't want AI to access
  - Reference materials that don't need AI analysis
  - Large files that would consume excessive tokens

**Example scenario**: You've uploaded a confidential contract for reference but don't want any AI model to process its contents.

### ðŸŸ¡ Summary Only (Sources)
**"ðŸŸ¡ insights" - Available for sources only**

- **What it does**: Shares only AI-generated insights and summaries, never the full document text
- **Data sharing**: Processed summaries, key points, and transformations
- **Use cases**:
  - Balancing functionality with privacy
  - Reducing token consumption while maintaining usefulness
  - Large documents where full text isn't necessary
  - Cost-effective AI interactions

**Example scenario**: You have a 50-page research paper where you only need the AI to understand the key findings and conclusions, not every detail.

### ðŸŸ¢ Full Content
**"ðŸŸ¢ full content"**

- **What it does**: Provides complete access to the source text or note content
- **Data sharing**: Entire document or note content sent to AI models
- **Use cases**:
  - Documents requiring detailed analysis
  - Short documents where full context is needed
  - Sources requiring precise citation and quotation
  - Interactive research where AI needs complete information

**Example scenario**: You're analyzing a specific methodology section and need the AI to reference exact procedures and technical details.

### Dynamic Privacy Controls

Context levels can be adjusted in real-time:

1. **Per-Conversation**: Change context for specific AI interactions
2. **Per-Source**: Individual control over each document or note
3. **Per-Project**: Notebook-level privacy settings
4. **Per-Provider**: Different context levels for different AI models

## Performance Optimization

### Token Management

Context levels directly impact token consumption:

**Token Usage by Context Level**:
- **Not in Context**: 0 tokens consumed
- **Summary Only**: 10-20% of full document tokens
- **Full Content**: 100% of document tokens

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Use summary context for background materials
- Reserve full content for critical analysis
- Exclude large reference documents
- Monitor token usage through built-in counters

### Processing Speed

Context management affects response times:

**Performance Characteristics**:
- **Summary Context**: Faster processing, smaller payloads
- **Full Content**: Slower processing, larger payloads
- **Mixed Strategy**: Balanced performance and functionality

**Speed Optimization Tips**:
- Start with summary context for exploration
- Switch to full content for detailed analysis
- Use context exclusion for irrelevant materials
- Cache frequently accessed summaries

### Memory Management

Context levels help manage system resources:

**Memory Usage**:
- **Context Exclusion**: Reduces memory footprint
- **Summary Processing**: Efficient memory utilization
- **Full Content**: Higher memory requirements

**Resource Optimization**:
- Use selective context for large document collections
- Implement context rotation for different research phases
- Monitor system performance metrics
- Archive unused context materials

## AI Model Integration and Cost Management

### Provider-Specific Considerations

Different AI providers have varying cost structures:

**OpenAI GPT Models**:
- Input tokens: $0.01-$0.06 per 1K tokens
- Output tokens: $0.03-$0.12 per 1K tokens
- **Strategy**: Use summary context for exploration, full content for analysis

**Anthropic Claude**:
- Input tokens: $0.003-$0.015 per 1K tokens
- Output tokens: $0.015-$0.075 per 1K tokens
- **Strategy**: Leverage higher context windows with selective full content

**Google Gemini**:
- Input tokens: $0.001-$0.0075 per 1K tokens
- Output tokens: $0.002-$0.03 per 1K tokens
- **Strategy**: Cost-effective for larger context, good for mixed strategies

**Local Models (Ollama)**:
- No per-token costs
- **Strategy**: Use full content freely, optimize for quality

### Cost Calculation Tools

Open Notebook provides built-in cost estimation:

```python
# Example cost calculation
total_tokens = context_response.total_tokens
estimated_cost = calculate_cost(total_tokens, model_provider, model_name)
```

**Cost Monitoring Features**:
- Real-time token counting
- Per-conversation cost tracking
- Model comparison tools
- Budget alerts and limits

### Multi-Model Strategies

Leverage different models for different context levels:
