# Documentation Restructure Outline

## Overview
This document proposes a complete restructuring of Open Notebook's documentation to improve user experience, reduce confusion, and create a logical progression from discovery to mastery.

## Current Problems Summary
- No clear entry point for new users
- Fragmented setup instructions across multiple files
- Significant content duplication (models, Docker setup)
- Missing navigation structure and user journey
- Language inconsistency (Portuguese META specs vs English docs)
- Critical gaps (architecture, API docs, troubleshooting)

## Content Consolidation Strategy

### Files to Merge/Eliminate
- **setup_guide/README.md** → Merge into `/docs/getting-started/quick-start.md`
- **setup_guide/DOCKER_SETUP_ADVANCED.md** → Merge into `/docs/deployment/docker.md`
- **docs/single-container-deployment.md** → Move to `/docs/deployment/single-container.md`
- **docs/models.md** + **docs/model-providers.md** → Consolidate into `/docs/features/ai-models.md`
- **docs/SETUP.md** → Delete (referenced but doesn't exist)

### Content to Extract from README.md
- **Provider Support Matrix** → Move to `/docs/features/ai-models.md`
- **Installation Instructions** → Move to `/docs/getting-started/installation.md`
- **Docker Setup** → Move to `/docs/deployment/docker.md`
- **Feature List** → Move to `/docs/getting-started/introduction.md`

### New Content to Create
- **Architecture diagrams** for `/docs/development/architecture.md`
- **API documentation** for `/docs/development/api-reference.md`
- **Troubleshooting guide** for `/docs/troubleshooting/common-issues.md`
- **Migration guides** for version updates

## Navigation Structure

### Primary Navigation
Each major section should have an index file with:
- Section overview
- Links to all files in section
- Recommended reading order
- Next steps navigation

### Cross-References
- Strategic linking between related topics
- "See also" sections
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Back-to-top links

### Search and Discovery
- Comprehensive table of contents
- Glossary of terms
- Tag-based organization
- Visual flowcharts for complex processes

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core User Journey
1. `/docs/getting-started/` complete section
2. Updated README.md with clear overview
3. `/docs/user-guide/` basic files

### Phase 2: Feature Documentation
1. `/docs/features/` complete section
2. `/docs/deployment/` consolidation
3. Content deduplication

### Phase 3: Technical Documentation
1. `/docs/development/` complete section
2. `/docs/troubleshooting/` complete section
3. `/docs/migration/` creation

### Phase 4: Polish and Optimization
1. Navigation improvements
2. Cross-reference optimization
3. Visual enhancements
4. User testing and feedback

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Time to first successful setup
- User retention after initial install
- Support ticket reduction
