- **Reduced scope**: Less complex than eliminating all tabs
- **Lower risk**: Episodes functionality completely preserved

### Risk Mitigation
- Episodes tab remains completely unchanged (zero regression risk)
- Each phase maintains working functionality
- Rollback possible at any phase boundary
- Comprehensive testing prevents regressions

### Total Estimated Time: 12 hours (7 phases × ~1.7 hours average)
